## Software Design and Engineering Artifact

The artifact that is being focused on in this segment of my project is my final project from by CS405 course.  The project was to complete a new security policy that outlines our greatest threats in coding and to propose new coding principals to adhere to as well as a plan to implement these changes.  Finally the project included creating a PowerPoint presentation in order to convey the new policy to the resto of my organization. I completed this project originally earlier this year in 2023.
	I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because not only does it demonstrate my knowledge of Software Engineering and design, but it highlights my understanding of secure coding principals and skills in developing new policy and conveying my ideas of best practices to a large audience.  The specific areas in which this artifact showcase my skills are the areas where I lay out compliant code as well as non-compliant code.  Also, the PowerPoint presentation showcases my abilities to easily display this information to be digestible and understood by a wide audience.  This artifact was improved by correcting some errors that I discovered on my security policy document specifically when it came to ranking the priority levels in my Summary of Risk Assessments.  I also improved my presentation by cleaning up a few slides where information was not being clearly displayed.  I provided more detail on my Threats matrix to make that more understandable just by reading it. I also added a slide to discuss the automation tools more in depth to give a better understanding of what the tools do and how we could use them.
	I did meet the objectives that I planned on in this milestone.  By making these enhancements I was able to demonstrate a security mindset which is evident in my detail surrounding each new coding principal, its security and priority level as well as itâ€™s likelihood of causing a security vulnerability in the future. 
	By enhancing this artifact I was able to learn that doing a deeper dive into security principals sometimes yields a more foundational level of understanding when it comes to best practices and security vulnerabilities.  I feel like when I originally completed this project I rushed through it a bit and did not fully get to grasp what the automation tools were that I was pitching and by enhancing this I now have learned of new tools that can help mitigate risks and I can bring this knowledge into my professional career by suggesting these tools as potential security enhancements for organizations that do not use anything like them.
