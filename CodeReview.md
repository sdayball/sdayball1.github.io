## Introduction

### Software Engineering/Design

I will be taking my zoo monitoring program from IT-145 and use it for the Software Engineering and design category. Right now, the code uses rudimentary files with low amount of availability to check on the animals and habitat. I will be enhancing the program to make it involve data files for more animals and habitats as well as an employee section, zoo transfer system, and improved code structure to be even more modular and efficient.


### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

I will be working with the same artifact as the above, my zoo monitoring program from IT 145. I will be for this assigning a more robust data structure reading structure for the data kept. Currently it uses just .txt files and reads it line for line for the data output. For this step I will be adding more data per file and retrieving data from a SQL database instead of a text file based off guesses of the file and amounts. The output will also vary based on data presented in the result set instead of just showing all the data and reacting to rudimentary call signs. This part also ties into the next part of the enhancements.

### Category Three: Databases

This artifact is going to be in theory made from scratch, but you can consider it an improvement on the data structure held within the Zoo monitoring program which at the start of this project were mere text files. I will be creating a SQL Server DB using Microsoft SQL Server. And creating the relation databases for the zoo monitoring program to access. All the object types will be tables that the program will read from and output a result set from.

## Code Review

A code review is a vital part of the software development lifecycle.  Code review involves doing just what the name would imply and reviewing either your own code or code from one of your peers.  This would involve checking for any syntax errors, or looking for functions that were written that may be redundant or any security vulnerabilities such as infinite loops or unrestricted user inputs.  This is a wide range of items to be reviewing for and during the code review it is important to point out any areas where you may question what the functionality is because another important part of the SDLC is to comment your code so that others can be clear on what your code is doing.
	Code review is an important practice for computer science professionals because this is a great way of proof reading our code so that we are not releasing sloppy or disfunctional code into production environments. It also is a great way to learn how to code better. By reading other users code you can help pick up on tricks they may know that you do not.  On the other hand, having someone correct your code will help you learn what pitfalls and mistakes to avoid in the future.  Overall, doing code reviews is beneficial for everyone involved and is an important process to maintain throughout your career.
	This occurs after initial code is written and tested.  This can be done by yourself or you can have a peer review your code with you and provide additional insight.  Ideally this should always be done prior to deploying your code to a live or production environment to avoid any conflicts with live code.
	Some best practices that I would advocate for include leaving plenty of notes while reviewing. As soon as you see something that should be fixed, corrected or adjusted you should note it immediately.  It is very easy to forget about small things the more you read through code so if you can note them and do so in a way where it stands out from normal code comments this will help you not miss any areas that need to be corrected.  Also, I would recommend doing code review with people you trust to be honest with you. This is important because if people do not want to hurt feelings or step on toes then this could lead to issues where they do not mention something that needs to be fixed or done in a better way for fear of how it may make you feel. On the other side of that I always advocate for being fully honest when reviewing someone else’s code as it does not help anyone learn in the long run if you don’t speak up.
