## Databases Artifact Description
Sam Dayball Milestone 4 Narrative
	The artifact that I have included here was my final project from the course DAT220 and it was a detailed report utilizing different data mining techniques and methods of analyzing and reporting on large amounts of data. The purpose of this project was to help a restaurant chain, Bubba Gump Shrimp, optimize customer engagement and increase new and returning customer flow to the restaurants.  This project was originally completed in December of 2021.  
	I selected this artifact to put in my portfolio because it displays my ability to combine data that has been recovered and turn it into a visual tool to help understand and recognize trends in the restaurants history.  The specific components that showcase my skills are the use of the different types of graphs and diagrams like linear regression models, logistic regression models, Dendograms, and more.  I improved this artifact by revising my analysis and recommendations to the management of Bubba Gump Shrimp in a more professional and clearly stated manner.  I wasn’t able to access the tools I used to create these diagrams originally so I was unable to include additional or more enhanced graphics to the report, however my review, analysis and next step recommendations have all been revised and improved on.
	I did meet my course objectives that I planned to meet with this enhancement by demonstrating the skills and outcomes of designing and delivering a professional-quality written and visual communications that are coherent and technically sound along with using strategies for building a collaborative environment in the field of computer science. I do not have any plans to update my outcome-coverage plans as I believe I have adequately enhanced and achieved the outcomes I set out to achieve originally.
	By enhancing this artifact I have refined my skills on professional reporting and analyzing large amounts of data.  Sometimes when creating reports it is easy to get bogged down in fine details which causes the messaging to suffer.  I have improved my skills in clearly communicating my thoughts in a professional manner to allow the audience to better understand the points being made and my recommendations for improvement.

## Database Artifact 
DAT220 Final Project
What can the sample of these customers tell us in regards to how can we improve or better predict the likelihood of retail sales either in store or on the web store.  If we can get a clear focus on what our customer base loves the most about our franchise then we can promote that and put it front and center of our focus in order to improve it and get more people exposed to it to drive sales and exposure. Another thing this will tell is what people are least excited about with our franchise and how we can go about improving that area of business.  
The overall business problem that I am trying to solve with analyzing this data is, can we more accurately and efficiently drive business online to our target customer base?  I need to find where we do well and what is causing that so that way we can leverage that success into areas where we can improve so that we can grow this business even more.  
The analytic method I’m using here will indicate what is the original source of customers.  Is it word of mouth, advertising, or is it the movie? This helps us understand how we are getting people in the doors.  Next I’m analyzing, who is doing the most business with us.  If we can target where our biggest customer base is and what demographics they fall into then we can more effectively target marketing campaigns to them.  If we can analyze this data and accurately predict factors that will lead to online sales then we can take advantage of those and drive sales up for the stores and overall business.
For this project I am utilizing a sample of customer surveys in order to create a report that may show trends, clusters and predictability in order to measure areas where we can improve.    Since we have a significant amount of data from a wide variety of different people and places I think this will be useful in the analysis of our data.
	For visualizations I plan on using a Linear Regression model, a Cluster Analysis with Hierarchical Clustering, a Scatterplot Matrix, and a logistic regression model in order to demonstrate what the data provided to us can reflect and how we can utilize that information to our benefit.
	Our main research question that needs to be addressed in this report is, how can the data provided show us predictability with our customer base and where we need to focus our marketing efforts in order to drive more business to the webstore and online retailers?
	I will determine if the research question was answered by analyzing the data provided and if we can determine that there are definite trends based on the data that was provided then we should be able to come to the conclusion that we can accurately target marketing strategies accordingly.  Also, if there are natural clusters that we can measure together or show a strong correlation then we can determine that the information is useful and mark it as progression towards improving business.
	Good follow-up questions that will be important for me to include on the initial research is, are there any potential errors in the data given?  Are there any short comings that this initial data provided may include?  If we can determine a predictive model that indicates a high accuracy of results then how do we use that to our advantage?
There are other sources of information that can help address my line of inquiry but where they may fall short is not taking into account the niche market of this movie based restaurant experience into account.  However these external resources can help me indicate customer trends when it comes to buying merchandise on a regular basis.
My data and charts have been provided at the end of this report for analysis.  To begin I would like to discuss the results surrounding our cluster analysis.  The use of they Dendogram and Scatterplot help us identify how many natural clusters we have in our sample data.  The dendogram shows nineteen natural clusters so we can start to break down the categories of data that we have.  This is a very important first step in analyzing our sample data because it allows us to get a high level view of how we can group our data and take different approaches at analyzing it.  However this high level view can provide some limitations.  For example, the scatterplot that we have does not provide extremely specific data so we are required to draw estimates from which could potentially lead to errors in reporting. 
	The next part of data I would like to address is my logistical regression model of web purchases by web visits.  This model and data analysis is very telling of how we can estimate web store purchases based on the number of visits each customer makes.  Being able to set a clear trend on this really helps address the business questions of where, when and how we are generating online retail business.  By understanding this trend we can establish that if we can drive more traffic to the webstore or get reoccurring visitors to the webstore we can increase sales revenue through that channel.  However, this data set also does have limitations.  We created this regression model for two points of data yet we have much more data to analyze.  The limitation with this model type is that we do not see the interaction between multiple sets of data and this could take some significant time to measure all the data together in this format.
	Finally, I would like to discuss the linear regression models generated from my last report.  For linear regression we measured the Bivariate fit of webstore spending by income, the bivariate fit of Married by webstore spend, and a oneway analysis of webstore spending by state.  This data reporting is also helpful in identifying groups of related data the same way that the logistical regression did but this helps us gain a wider understanding of how all of our data is related and how we can benefit from understanding it.  The analysis of webstore spend by income and the webstore spend by state really helps us identify our biggest customer base.  We can identify the exact range of income and location that the majority of our customers fall into.  We can utilize this data to help target more marketing campaigns to increase their likelihood of visiting our webstore and making a purchase.  We also know what areas we struggle to gain a customer base so that helps us understand where we need to focus our customer growth campaigns.  However, this data does have it’s limitations as well since this is just a sample of data we do not get the complete picture for our customer base.  Also, in analyzing categories this way we may find categories that may show some correspondence where there is none. For example our analysis of the webstore spending by marriage.  This resulting data does not really provide us much clarity or clear trends in customer base so this is largely un-helpful in our challenge to increase sales.
	My analysis reflects organized and stepwise approach by organizing clearly related data and reflecting trends to address our business problem.  One aspect that is beyond my control is the limited scope of data that we have currently.  Sources of error that we needed to resolve before successfully running these reports is an organization of different data types in order to have accurate diagrams to report.  The most meaningful pattern I discovered was webstore purchase by number of visits.  I think this shows a clear indication that if we can get repeat visitors to the webstore we will greatly increase sales.  In using these data mining tools I did not directly encounter inaccurate depictions of data.  
	Some other models or analytic methods that we could utilize for this project would be either a descriptive or predictive model.  Using these methods we may be able to more accurately predict who is most likely to make purchases on the webstore and under what circumstances they would do that.  With this type of information we can make better predictions of sales cycles and make improvements to marketing campaigns in order to increase sales success more consistently.

Based on the display of these two regression models, we can quantitatively observe notable trends in webstore purchases. Specifically, it is evident that a significant proportion of our webstore purchases, approximately 60%, originate from customers falling within the income range of forty thousand to seventy thousand dollars per year. This finding strongly suggests that our target audience primarily lies within this income bracket.
Additionally, the regression models reveal a compelling correlation between the frequency of webstore visits and the likelihood of a purchase. For each additional visit made by an individual, the likelihood of a purchase increases by approximately 20%. This insight underscores the importance of nurturing customer relationships and encouraging repeat visits to drive more purchases.
Understanding our target audience and recognizing the significance of repeat visits, we can devise targeted marketing campaigns that specifically cater to customers in the forty to seventy thousand dollars income range. Furthermore, implementing customer retention strategies, such as personalized recommendations and loyalty programs, can effectively increase the number of repeat visits, leading to a higher conversion rate and increased revenue.
These insights offer valuable guidance for our business goals, empowering us to focus our efforts on reaching the right audience and fostering strong customer relationships. By aligning our strategies with these trends, we can maximize the webstore's potential and achieve continued growth and success.
Validity, Reliability, Limitations
Overall, the validity for this report remains pretty strong.  We have a good sample size of our customer base so we can externally validate our data to multiple questions.  Based on our reporting data we had nineteen natural clusters which helps indicate a healthy external validation.  Reliability also seems to be fairly good with this data.  There were not many inconsistencies with the data provided and the few that were there were fairly minor and inconsequential. The limitations of this report are corresponding with the sample size of data.  While this data shows clear trends in certain aspects of analyzing our data with a larger data set it is almost certain that some of this reporting would change.
Resulting Decision Influence
I would advise that decisions that stem from this assessment are made in relation to the sample data size.  Essentially I would make suggestions that indicate that the more traffic we can get to the webstore will increase the size of our webstore sales especially within the specified income demographic we know about.  However, I would not use this as a universal solution since we only have a sample size of five hundred customers I think incremental changes should be made and in a few more months this should be revisited with larger data sets to see if the trends remain the same.
Visual Evaluation
In this report, I utilized two regression models - Linear Regression and Logistic Regression - to represent the data accurately and clearly. The interpretations of the coefficient values and the R-squared measure were straightforward, making the models highly interpretable.
To enhance understanding and readability, I employed clean and organized data charts, including bar charts and scatter plots. These visualizations effectively conveyed the data patterns and relationships, facilitating a deeper comprehension of the findings.
Next Steps
1.	Increase Webstore Traffic: To drive more traffic to the webstore, we can explore targeted marketing campaigns, search engine optimization (SEO) strategies, and collaborations with influencers to expand our online presence.
2.	Encourage Repeat Visits: To foster repeat visits, implementing personalized recommendations, offering loyalty programs, and enhancing the user experience through a user-friendly interface can be effective.
3.	Target Primary Income Demographic: Identifying our primary income demographic and tailoring marketing efforts specifically to them can maximize conversion rates. Utilizing data analytics and customer segmentation will help in precise targeting.
Below are all the models I used in measuring this information and the concurrent analysis of all of the data provided.
